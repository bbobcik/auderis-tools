/**
 * Provides mechanism for semantically safe access to configuration data. The term "configuration
 * data" represents data that are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Usually immutable during the application process life</li>
 *     <li>Represented by primitive entities (such as strings, numbers etc.) or low-level, less-structured classes,
 *     such as {@link java.util.UUID}, {@link java.net.InetAddress} and similar</li>
 * </ul>
 * The typical sources of configuration data may be for example property files, resource bundles, one-time queries
 * to a database or LDAP, system properties and others.
 *
 * <p>This package allows turning regular interfaces into accessors of configuration data. This approach
 * has several benefits:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Programmer defines configuration entries semantics (data type + entry name) at compile time.</li>
 *     <li>Configuration entries may (<em>should!</em>) be documented via normal Javadoc.</li>
 *     <li>Usages of configuration entries may be found by usual IDE tools.</li>
 *     <li>Client of configuration data accessor doesn't have to be concerned with the actual source
 *     of configuration data.</li>
 *     <li>A certain level of intelligence is used to turn configuration data source values into requested
 *     data types. For example text-represented numbers would be correctly transformed to primitives.</li>
 * </ul>
